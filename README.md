For windows users who don't have Python you can download it at this address: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

For MacOSX and systems Linux users if you don't have Miniconda3, I recommend you to download it with the link above.

For the install on Linux, enter in a shell the command below : `bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh` 

For the install on MacOSX, enter in a shell the command below : `bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh`
### Librairies
- Numpy
- Scipy
- Biopython
### Pdb file with hydrogens
The script needs the hydrogens to be in the pdb file to work properly. For add the hydrogens you can go in [Molprobity](http://molprobity.biochem.duke.edu/), upload your file or fetch the pdb code and add hydrogens. For Linux users you can donwload the reduce program wit the command : `conda install -c ostrokach-forge reduce`
